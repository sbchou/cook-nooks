Cook-Nooks
www.cook-nooks.appspot.com

A very simple and user-friendly web app for chefs and foodies to create a Cook-Nook: a personal log of their recipes in their own little corner of the web. Features a single-column Tumblr-style layout.

Created because I wanted an easier and more aesthetically appealing way to store my collection of favorite recipes on the internet than a Google Doc. Existing options seemed to be more focused on sharing recipes and social networking, whereas I needed a personal journal, to share (or not to share!) at my own disposal.

In short: a recipe box Hemingway would approve of.

WARNING:
Cook-Nooks is still evolving, so use with caution!

To-Do:
Print recipe feature
Email recipe feature
Delete recipe feature


it's Your nook
using an old google doc
your personal recipe box, easy on eyes, on the web
